# Bank Simulator

This is a simple command-line Bank Simulator written in Python. It allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit money, and (in the future) withdraw funds from their balance or savings.

## Features
- **Account Creation:** Users can create a new account by providing their name and a two-digit PIN.
- **Login:** Existing users can log in using their name and PIN.
- **Deposit:** Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Menu Navigation:** Simple text-based menu for navigation.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

## Usage
- Follow the on-screen prompts to log in or create a new account.
- After logging in, you can deposit money or (in the future) withdraw from your balance or savings.
- To exit, select the 'Exit' option from the menu.

## Notes
- The account data is stored in-memory and will reset when the program is restarted.
- This project is for educational purposes and does not implement real security or persistent storage.

## Future Improvements
- Implement withdrawal functionality.
- Add persistent storage (e.g., file or database).
- Improve input validation and error handling.
